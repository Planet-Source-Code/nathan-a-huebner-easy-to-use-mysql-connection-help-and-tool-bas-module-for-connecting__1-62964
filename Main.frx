ÿŸIMPORTANT: IF YOU WANT THIS TO WORK!

Even though you see that this code WILL work if your database is running, if 
you EVER put this BAS into another project, you must first ADD the Microsoft 
ADO Control to your Components, and then PUT the CONTROL onto a 
FORM. After you put it on the form, delete it, as it has loaded what it needs. 
Maybe there's a way around this, but I haven't tried to figure it out. This is just a 
fix for this error. BUT DO NOT REMOVE IT FROM YOUR COMPONENTS, 
OR THE BAS WILL NO LONGER WORK.

Please note, the ADO control is already loaded into this project. Only follow these 
instructions if you intend to use the BAS Module in a different project.

ADD Microsoft ADO Control
Create the control by placing it onto any form in your project.

HOW TO ADD A COMPONENT (Microsoft ADO Control):
From the file menu in Visual Basic, click Project > References
A large list will appear, scroll down to Microsoft ADO Control, and Check it. Click OK and 
then click and drag the control to any form in the project (it doesn't have to be any particular 
form, we just need the control into the project).

I have no idea why it doesn't work any other way, this is the only way I can do it.

Then setup your User name, Server, Database, and to QUERY a database simply do: 
QueryDatabase("SELECT count(*) from MYTABLE;")  this will return the count(*) for 
MYTABLE, into getCell("count(*)",1).
